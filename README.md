# Classified-Mission-Game
This repo has been made for the purpose of programming a side scroller game using C# windows forms, it's called "Classified Mission" and it's about a space mission that is highly classified to be discussed with the public, its goal is to collect as many resources as possible from different planets and astroids. The player will be facing a different set of challanges which would make it harder to complete the game!
